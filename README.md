# MangosOrange-Mnist
# MNIST Digit Classification

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained to recognize digits (0-9) based on grayscale images.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Streamlit
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits used for training various image processing systems. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
